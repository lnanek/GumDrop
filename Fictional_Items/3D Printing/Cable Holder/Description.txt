you can either purchase double sided tape from any hardware stores or can insert 2 quarters on the bottom to make it heavier if you dont have access to double sided tape.

CableHolder_FIX file is the normal fixed design, just print it out and tape it to the table. (No support is needed) 
CableHolder_with_coin_FIX file has a coin hole underneath for inserting coins so it can become heavy. (Support is needed)
