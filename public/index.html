				<p><b>Bernal Heights</b></p>
				<p>Many San Franciscans never travel to Bernal Heights, located as it is at the southern edge of the Mission valley, served by only a few city bus lines and perched atop a steep hill, to boot.</p>
			</div>
    </div>
    
    <div><div><img src="data/castro.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>The Castro
    </b></p><p>What was once dairy farms and dirt roads is now one of the city's most vibrant and cohesive communities, saturated with shops and bars so popular that patrons spill out onto the street.</p></div></div>
    

<div><div><img src="data/ba-chinesenewyea_0498008311_part3.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Chinatown
</b></p><p>The reality of Chinatown is that there are two Chinatowns: One belongs to the locals, the other charms the tourists. They draw more visitors annually than the Golden Gate Bridge.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/colevalley.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Cole Valley
</b></p><p>"Community" is the operative word in this thin slice of San Francisco, bordered on the west by Stanyan Street and the Sutro Forest, on the south by Tank Hill and on the east by Clayton Street.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/decoghettobig.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Deco Ghetto
</b></p><p>With a surprising number of cafes, shops and bars and a brand-new freeway off-ramp and a widened boulevard on the way, this San Francisco neighborhood is coming into its own.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/fishermanswharf.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Fisherman's Wharf
</b></p><p>All San Franciscans love to hate Fisherman's Wharf. But secretly, everyone likes it a little, and having guests from out of town is the perfect excuse for cynical old-timers to go.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/goldengatepark.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Golden Gate Park
</b></p><p>What's larger than New York's Central Park, once consisted of sand dunes, is now covered by over a million trees? Golden Gate Park — the ultimate haven away from urban chaos.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/haightashbury.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>The Haight
</b></p><p>Save for a few hippie relics, the Haight today is a whole new scene. Exclusive boutiques, high-end vintage-clothing shops, Internet cafés and hip restaurants have settled in.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/story_centerpiece_main.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Hayes Valley
</b></p><p>Unlike some other parts of San Francisco, Hayes Valley has managed to retain a sense of community and a nonexclusive feel despite the fast build-up and high price tags.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/richmond-200x267-lake.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Inner Richmond
</b></p><p>+Family Friendly<br />The Inner Richmond is a practical and comfortable neighborhood with a citywide reputation for fantastic restaurants.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/ga_surreal_bernal01.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Inner Sunset
</b></p><p>Many San Franciscans name the Inner Sunset as their favorite neighborhood, despite the fact that it suffers some of the worst weather in the entire Bay Area.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/marina.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>The Marina
</b></p><p>Today the apartments, shops and restaurants are bursting with beautiful, young and fit 20- and 30-somethings. The singles scene is hopping on Friday and Saturday nights.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/missionpotbig.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>The Mission: Mission to Potrero
</b></p><p>+Singles Friendly!<br />Changes in the city caused a crop of Internet startups to spring up around the Potrero Hill side of the Mission, and with them a flock of chic restaurants and bars.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/mission.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>The Mission: 16th & Valencia Streets
</b></p><p>+Singles Friendly!<br />Some say the inner Mission District has undergone far more hipsterfication than gentrification — the result of a surfeit of thrift stores, dive bars, coffeehouses, bookstores, and galleries.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/wb_murals06049lh.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>The Mission: 24th Street
</b></p><p>+Singles Friendly!<br />The stretch of 24th running from Mission to Potrero Streets boasts a vast number of unique stores and restaurants, as well as the greatest concentration of murals in the city.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/missionvalbig.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>The Mission: Dolores & Valencia Corridor
</b></p><p>Hilly, quiet and beautiful, Dolores Street is shaded by palm trees and lined by grand Victorians. Dolores Park remains a favorite for those who wish to retreat from hustle and bustle.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/cm_fountain.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Nob Hill
</b></p><p>Nob Hill is one of San Francisco's signature neighborhoods, renowned for its city landmarks and the famous hotels that border Huntington Park.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="photos/DoloresPark-NoeValley.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Noe Valley
</b></p><p>+Family friendly<br />Noe Valley is a neighborhood of contradictions. It's home to both liberals and conservatives, it has attracted the working class, dot.com millionaires, Hollywood film crews, and more.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/northbeach.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>North Beach
</b></p><p>+Singles Friendly!<br />North Beach is best known as San Francisco's Little Italy, with its high density of check-clothed ristorantes, caffes and Old World delicatessens.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="photos/OuterRichmond-SutroBaths.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Outer Richmond
</b></p><p><p>+Family Friendly!<br />This spot retains a neighborhood feel along its main shopping streets and prime (albeit foggy) real estate. The many waves of immigrants who have settled have also put their stamp on it.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/outersunset.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Outer Sunset
</b></p><p>+Family Friendly!<br />Despite a well-earned reputation as the place fog calls home, there's a lot to explore in this area's three major neighborhoods: the Outer Sunset, Parkside and West Portal.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="photos/OuterSunset.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Parkside
</b></p><p>+Family Friendly!<br />Neighborhood of Outer Sunset.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/park_merced.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Park Merced Condos
</b></p><p>+Family Friendly!<br />Parkmerced is located in Southwest San Francisco only 10 miles from downtown. Next to Lake Merced and nearby to Ocean Beach, the San Francisco Zoo, five golf courses, with direct access to scenic walking trails and over 640 acres of public open space.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="photos/SouthBeach.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>South Beach
</b></p><p>+Singles Friendly!<br />The South Beach neighborhood encompasses the moderately affluent, medium-density mixed-use blocks which border The Embarcadero and King Street from south of the Bay Bridge down to 3rd Street.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="photos/FiDi-SF.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Financial District
</b></p><p>+Singles Friendly!<br />Home to the city's largest concentration of corporate headquarters, law firms, insurance companies, real estate firms, banks, savings and loans, and other financial institutions.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/nopa.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>NOPA (Panhandle)
</b></p><p>+Family Friendly!<br />North Panhandle is the 24th most walkable neighborhood in San Francisco with 10,973 residents. North Panhandle has excellent public transportation and is a biker’s paradise.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="images/laurel-600.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Laurel Heights
</b></p><p>+Family Friendly!<br />Laurel Heights is a neighborhood to the south of the Presidio and east of the Richmond District. It is bordered by Geary Boulevard or the University of San Francisco campus to the south, Arguello Boulevard to the west, California Street to the north and Presidio Avenue to the east.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/pacific_heights_mansion.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Pacific Heights
</b></p><p>This elegant neighborhood embodies Hollywood's vision of San Francisco, and its Victorian mansions and Cinemascope views of the Golden Gate Bridge make the area a favorite with visitors.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/potrerohillbig.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Potrero Hill
</b></p><p>The neighborhood is relatively isolated by freeways and large tracts of industrial landscape, giving Potrero Hill its own pace and a feeling of distance from "San Francisco."</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/russianhillbig.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Russian Hill
</b></p><p>Russian Hill, a residential neighborhood with pockets of restaurants and shops, feels more visitor-friendly than its more formal neighbor, Nob Hill. The views are just as dazzling.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/South_of_Market,_San_Francisco.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>SoMa
</b></p><p>+Singles Friendly!<br />The neighborhood is a patchwork of warehouses, swanky nightspots, residential hotels, art spaces, loft apartments, furniture showrooms, and tenacious Internet companies.</p></div></div>

<div><div><img src="data/tenderloin.jpg" width="100%" /><br /><p><b>Tenderloin
</b></p><p>If you can get past its bad rap, you'll find this one of the city's most exciting and diverse locales, with unpolished gems in the form of incredible cooking, great bar scenes and live music.</p></div></div>
